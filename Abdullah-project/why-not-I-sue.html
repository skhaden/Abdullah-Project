      You shouldn't sue me because I am just an 11-year old kid who it'his first time coding, hard to tell right.
      I am doing this for my 5th Grade project, "Genius Hour" even though it takes way more than an hour, like way, way more.
      If it makes you feel better SwagRockruff isn't a company, it is just the name I use for all my game accounts.
