          <p> Oh, I am glad you asked. I'm going to tell you about a little something called freelancing.
            Freelancing is when you get "hired" by companies to do some sort of coding for them, you have to
            give them a certain product in a set amount of time and they pay you, but you don't have to be restricted to a schedule.
            The company just pays you for the amount of time you spend on their product or just for the product it self.
            An important thing to do if you freelance is think of yourself as one-man company, one of the hard things abot freelancing is to make sure you don't give yourself
            too mcuh work. A cool thing about freelancing is that
            you can fire your clients if you don't like them or they are not giving you enough money. A part lots of people like is that people ask you to work for them,
            if it was any other job you would be the one asking for you to work for them. Lots of people who freelance also blog on the side.
            Okay so lets talk about the money. The money is insane. You can get $100/hour if you have a good skill set or even up to $1,000/hour. I
            am not even kidding. It is that insane. Another thing is that you can also learn other programming languages on the side which is incredibly useful. If you want a more in depth explantion here are some by

              <p> Oh, I am glad you asked. I'm going to tell you about a little something called freelancing.
                Freelancing is when you get "hired" by companies to do some sort of coding for them, you have to
                give them a certain product in a set amount of time and they pay you, but you don't have to be restricted to a schedule. That is useful because
                you can actually practice the coding you are learning, and you set some time for you to learn and for your job.
                Don't expect that much money from freelancing though, best case scenario is that you get paid $20/hour. A useful tip is to
                go after small local businesses. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfvB71a6vGg" target=_blank>youtube video</a> explaining that.
