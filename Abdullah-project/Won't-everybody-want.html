<p>
  It is true that lots of people want to become a coder. Though lots of people don't
  want to become a coder when they are 11 or 10 years old.
  Most kids want to be basketball players or doctors when they grow up. If you start to learn
  coding at this age and frequently learn to code and practice code, I can gurantee you will become a millionare in the future. Though you have
  to be smart with your jobs. Choose the ones that pay the most, if you don't like the company quit it you will get hired at a better job.
  The jobs in the world that need coding will only increase. The amount of computer science graduates compared to the amount of computing jobs
  is 1/10. Here is a table that shows Computer Science Graduates to open computing jobs.
