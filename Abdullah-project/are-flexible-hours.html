  <p>
    Yes, there are flexible hours. The typical coder spends 8 to 10 hours at work a day so you
    don't have to worry about waking up too early or not getting back in time to see your children.
    Sometimes if your schedule permits you can work from home. My sister usually works from home on Mondays and Fridays.
    Another thing about coding is that if you are mad that you are stuck inside to code when it is so nice outside
    you can go to the beach and code there.
